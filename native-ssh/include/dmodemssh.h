 * dmodemssh.h - D-Modem's SSH client, on libssh: the one engine every
 * app has (the desktops', iOS's, and Android's through JNI), so that
 * each has the same SSH.
 *
 * A connection (dmc_ssh) is driven by one thread that calls
 * dmc_ssh_poll() in a loop and acts on the events it hands back: the
 * server's key to trust or not, a login method to choose, a
 * keyboard-interactive round to answer, a channel's data.  Every other
 * call may come from any thread (a lock is taken): what is typed, a
 * window's new size, the answers.
 *
 * What it has: host keys checked by the caller (and in OpenSSH's
 * known_hosts when asked); logins by password, keyboard-interactive, a
 * private key (OpenSSH's, PEM), the system's agent, or OpenSSH's own
 * keys and agent at once (ssh's default); ~/.ssh/config when asked; Ed25519,
 * ECDSA and RSA keys; a shell on a pty, a command, direct TCP channels
 * (ssh -L and -D), remote listens (ssh -R) and the server's
 * agent channels (ssh -A) handed to the caller as channels.
 *
 * This file and dmodemssh.c are the same in D-Modem/gui (ssh/) and
 * D-Modem/app (native-ssh/): change both.
